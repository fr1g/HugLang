To Hug Anyone Else But Yourself:
"(%the hugged person's nickname || emoji referenced to a person%)"

To Hug Yourself:
"X"
(which means, hugging yourself can only be crossing arms in front of your chest. thanks for the Idea of 幻幻 and her friend(don't know name yet))

Exception:
If the bracketed string cannot be a reference of a instance/object/person, this will not become an expression of hugging, but using its basic meaning. 
- Such as, (1+2)*2. During the entire context, here's nothing or nobody can be referenced by using "1+2", not to mention that can be hugged twice.
- But if 1+2 referenced to a cute girl, this expression became even confusing. Still it need a context to determine it's to hug or not. Please take your language resolving mind on the objective existings.
